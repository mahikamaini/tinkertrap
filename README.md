# TinkerTrap Notebook
## Tuesday, May 13, 2025
### Task
Set up ESP-IDF code environment in VSCode on my Mac. 
### Notes
In order to test if the code runs, the ESP-IDF will need to be plugged into my laptop. This should arrive by the end of the week. 
### What I Accomplished
I followed a provided video tutorial to integrate the necessary software with the ESP-IDF VSCode extension. While it was meant for Windows, I was able to successfully integrate it with MacOS. I also cloned the GitHub repository for the ESP-IDF code, including the pedestrian-detect sample we will be using, and created a new repository, TinkerTrap, for our purposes.
